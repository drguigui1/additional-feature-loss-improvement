# Additional feature loss improvement

In this repository you will find a python code for:

- An implementation of the Logistic Regression in Pytorch with the Hashing Trick to manage high cardinality categorical features

- An implementation of the additional feature loss improvement described in the Chapelle's paper: https://people.csail.mit.edu/romer/papers/TISTRespPredAds.pdf

This method is used to estimate the loss improvement that we would have if we add a new feature in the model without retraining the model.
